Spoons

Rules & Setup:
Take the jokers out of the pile.
Decide who will be the first person, the trash, and in the middle.
You need one less spoon than the total amount of players.
Place the spoons in the middle.
Each player gets 4 cards and may only have 4 cards in their hand at a time.
The first player takes the top card from the deck and can either pass it on the next person or replace it with a card in his hand and pass the unwanted card.
The next player then takes the card passed on and does the same to his hand.
This continues until the last person, who takes the passed on card and places it into a discard pile, AKA the trash.
If there are still spoons remaining in the middle and the deck is finished:
   then the discard pile will be handed to the first player to be used.
To obtain the first spoon, a player must have 4 of a kind in their hand.
Once the first spoon has been taken, the remaining players may take the spoons.
The player who doesn't have a spoon once the round is over loses.
If a spoon is mistakenly taken:
   then restart the round.
